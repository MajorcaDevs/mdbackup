# Backblaze B2

Similar to [S3](s3.md), [B2][1] is a Object cloud storage that offers high performance, high availability and simple interface to store objects in the cloud. Like S3, it also uses keys to identify the objects and slashes `/` can be used to organize the objects.

The `backupsPath` in B2 is like a prefix for the object keys. It is recommended to put something here to easily organise the backups from the rest of files in the bucket. The initial slash `/` is removed when uploading the files. You don't need to create anything under the `backupsPath` prefix, it will be created automatically with the upload.

The content type of the files will be guessed and set in the metadata when uploading.

To start using B2, you must get and define the `keyId`, `appKey` and `bucket`. If `password` is defined, the files will be protected using this setting as password.

!!! Warning
    The `backupsPath` must start with initial slash `/`.

## Dependencies

In order to use B2, you must install the following python packages:

- `b2sdk`
- `python-magic`
